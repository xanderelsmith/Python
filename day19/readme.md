Hi Everyone. Good evening.

Thanks to all who attended our last meeting. And to those who engaged with the material.
We finished Chapter 14. It was an insightful session. ðŸŽ‰

Get ready for what's next! Up is Chapter 15: The Art of Documentation.


"Dive into Chapter 15: The Art of Documentation! Uncover why documentation is vital, beyond 'self-documented code.' Master the craft of creating clear, effective guides, taking inspiration from Flutter's gold standard. Learn to communicate your code's purpose like a pro!"


in the famous words of Albert dart Einstein " E is equal to MC square, and documentating your code, it holds the planets together", 

We'll take our time with this chapter for deep engagement.
Our goal: everyone processes and applies these ideas.

We'll talk about 

1.   Life Cycle of Document Creation
2. Why we should document our code
3. Difference in the various documetation types and where to apply them.
4. If Albert Einstein actually wrote code (MaybeðŸ˜‚)
5. The 5W Approach to writing documentation.
6. DartDoc, a tool for  generating documentation


We'll find out if "We actually know how to document our code for future reference" or maybe
we should instead leave a "Dont delete this line, if not code base would crash
